When a user validates a stock picking with discrepancies, an e-mail is sent
using the template "Incorrect Delivery" (``mail_template_incorrect_delivery``)
detailing the discrepancies.

This template should be edited to send an e-mail to the correct e-mail address.
By default, it sends the e-mail from the company's address to the picking's
owner.
