Take the contracts of an employee into account when computing work time per
day.

When this module is installed, the number of hours an employee is supposed to
work is only computed from their contracts. Without contracts, the work time
per day is 0, instead of using the default companyâ€™s work schedule.

The start and end dates of contracts are taken into account, but the status
(state) of the contract is ignored.
