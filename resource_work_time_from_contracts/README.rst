Take the contracts of an employee into account when computing work time per
day.

When this module is installed, the number of hours an employee is supposed to
work is only computed from their contracts. Without contracts, the work time
per day is 0, instead of using the default work schedule of the company.

The start and end dates of contracts are taken into account, but the status
(state) of contracts are ignored.

This module also makes the work schedule (``resource.calendar``) of an
employee always equal to the work schedule of the company, and hides its field
on the employee form view. This is because this work schedule is only used to
store all the leaves (``resource.calendar.leaves``) of all employees and is
otherwise ignored.

Usage
=====

The number of work hours in a day is taken from the ``hours_per_day`` field of
the work schedule (``resource.calendar``). This field is automatically
computed when work intervals are edited, but its value can also be set
manually.

It is useful to set it manually in case of work schedules with irregular days.
For example, a work schedule of 8 hours per day for 4 days and 4 hours for 1
day should have its ``hours_per_day`` set to 8. This way, the total work time
for a week (used to compute leaves, for example) is exactly 4.5 days.
