This module was developped for clients paying a subscription fee for
functional support. We wanted to invoice a fixed amount per period, but
invoice excess time. This module provide a way for the clients and the
service provider to monitor the time spent to compare it with the
quantity bought.

Usage
=====

The time spent for the current period is indicated in the contract line.
Time spent for past periods is indicated in the previous invoices. Note
: this might be confusing if the contract is configured to create
invoices at the begining of the period.
