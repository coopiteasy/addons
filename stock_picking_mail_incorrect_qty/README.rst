Sends an e-mail when a stock picking is incomplete. The e-mail is split up in
four parts:

- Items that were not received at all.
- Items that were received, but not expected.
- Items of which too few were received.
- Items of which too many were received.

Usage
=====

When a user validates a stock picking with discrepancies, an e-mail is sent
using the template "Incorrect Delivery" (``mail_template_incorrect_delivery``)
detailing the discrepancies.

This template should be edited to send an e-mail to the correct e-mail address.
By default, it sends the e-mail from the company's address to the picking's
owner.
